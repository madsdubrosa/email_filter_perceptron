# email_filter_project

The Email Filter project uses machine learning to classify/identify spam emails vs. non-spam emails.

email_filter1.py uses the Perceptron algorithm to classify the emails. email_filter2.py uses SVM to classify the emails. 

spam_train.txt and spam_test.txt are the training and testing data used for this project.
